# Server
This server is written using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and
serves up the sample data in `data/orders.json`.

The data is generated using the `yarn generate` command.

You are free to make any improvements to the server implementation
that you feel are necessary or helpful, but it is not a requirement
of this exercise.
